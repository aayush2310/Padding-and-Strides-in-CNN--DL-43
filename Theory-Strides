shift in right direction during convolution=of 1 pixel
stride=1

stride=(1,1)
horizontal=1,vertical=1
stride can be changed

if i increase the stride,the size of feature map will get reduced.
if stride>1,it is called strided convolution.

strided convolutional:-skipping through the information.
Why strided convolutional?
1)When I want high level features from an image and do not want low level features(barikiyan),then stride should be increased.
2)Computing power -training becomes fast
