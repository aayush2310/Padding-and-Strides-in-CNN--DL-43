When we are doing convolutional operation,then the feature map we are getting,its size is smaller than image.
Now if i apply one more filter on this feature map,then size will decrease further.
--Problem with convolution-loose information about the image.
Border pixels become part of less number of convolutions as compared to the middle one.
The side pixels will have less say than the middle one.

Padding solves this problem.

In padding we add one row as border to the image so that the final image obtained has dimension as we want.In keras it is called 0 padding

In keras when we apply same then keras automatically identifies how much padding to be given to the image so that o/p image after convolution has desired dimension.
